- 👋 Hi, I’m @srob23, my name is Sebastián.
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in videogames, and I would like to eventually know how to make videogames from scratch.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Python, and a few other things.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that could teach me something new, really. I'm kind of new to all this.
- 📫 You can contact through here, or with my email: sebastianrmith@gmail.com
